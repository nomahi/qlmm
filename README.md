## Estimation of Absolute Effect Measures in Analyzing Clustered Categorical Outcome Data by Linear Mixed-Effects Model

The generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM) has been a standard statistical tool for analyzing clustered data in clinical and epidemiological studies, e.g., longitudinal studies, clustered randomized trials, and multi-center/regional studies. GLMM requires numerical integrations to implement maximum likelihood estimation, and computationally tractable statistical models that adopt canonical link functions have been widely used, e.g., logistic mixed-effects model for binary outcome (effect measure: odds ratio), Poisson mixed-effects model for count outcome (effect measure: rate ratio). However, absolute effect measures are relevant in assessing treatment or exposure effects for quantifying the impacts of the factors in public health or providing more precise information for the effect size of the treatment or exposure. Noma and Tsubaki (2025) provides a generic method to estimate absolute effect measures via simple calculations using linear mixed-effects model. This package provides a computational tool to calculate the confidence intervals and P-values of the corresponding measures.
